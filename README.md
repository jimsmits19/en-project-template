Elastic Node Project Template using Mocha for Unit Tests

Not much to see here.  Just a template for unit tests with mocha and ExpressJS running on Node.

```
npm init
npm install -g mocha
npm install -g Express
mocha # to run tests.
node index.js to launch express
```
You can install these without the -g to be local instead of global, but mocha failed to install that way on my machine.
